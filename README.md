# SQL_data_cleaning_RealEstateDB

In this SQL project, I've cleaned the Nashville housing data table for better analysis using intermediate to advanced SQL queries.

The Nashville data was available as an Excel file. I imported the table into MS-SQL Server and created a database in my local machine.

I performed various data cleaning techniques of SQL on the imported table using string functions, date functions, etc and achieved good results.
